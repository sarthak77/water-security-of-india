Dynamic changes in the classification of water-energy regions over India

I am looking for the answer to the following specific questions:

1) How the water and energy zones have transformed over the years in India.
2) A spatial and temporal change is present in the classification of water and energy zones of India?
3) Is there any expansion or reduction in space of these classifications
4) Any innovative thought on such analysis

For this, you may have to check for each grid point the classification and some dynamic clustering algorithm should help in getting such information.

-------------------------------------------

I would like to see a map of the classification of water-energy limited zones of India.
I am also interested to check if there is any increase or decrease of these areas.

--------------------------------------------

I have gone through the figures.

1) For each year you have classified the water-energy regions, which is the basic step to do.
2) As you can see there is a change in the classification for each year, particularly, if you can notice in the North-Eastern zone. How to quantify it ?
3) For each year there is a change in the grid points which is turning from water to energy or energy to water zones. How each grid point is changing?
4) If it is changing from which year onwards it is changing ?


My questions are very specific and now you have to explore the answers. some data minimg techniques should help.
Students also read some material to have an understanding about the problem which they are solving.
Try these two things.
