Dynamic changes in the classification of water-energy regions over India

I am looking for the answer to the following specific questions:

1) How the water and energy zones have transformed over the years in India.
2) A spatial and temporal change is present in the classification of water and energy zones of India?
3) Is there any expansion or reduction in space of these classifications
4) Any innovative thought on such analysis

For this, you may have to check for each grid point the classification and some dynamic clustering algorithm should help in getting such information.
